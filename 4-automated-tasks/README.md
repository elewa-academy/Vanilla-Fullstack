# Automated Build Scripts

There is a lot of work involved in building an application that needs to happen, but is time consuming and repetitive. For these tasks there are Build Tools. 

In this project we'll be learning how to use Gulp.js to write simple build scripts that automate the task of converting our multi-file ES6 code into single-file ES5 code for the browser.
