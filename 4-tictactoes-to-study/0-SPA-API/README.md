# TIC TAC TOE 4 - Separate Routes from Controllers

In this edition of TicTacToes we will be changing where we define the logic for our handlers.  Until now we've been defining our logic inline, directly in the route's callback.

With this example, we will see how to define the logic for our controller separately from defining our routes.  This is a good thing, notice how it is getting closer to what you have done with _cleancalc_.
