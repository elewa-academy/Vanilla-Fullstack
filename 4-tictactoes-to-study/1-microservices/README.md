# TIC TAC TOE 5 - Micro-Services
You may have noticed your Model, View, Routes and Controller files are getting pretty bloated.  If you want to change anything about how one data type is handled you have to go all over the place to make little changes here and there.  What if your application were organized by data-type and functionality?  It can be!

With Micro-Services architecture what you have is a collection of mini MVC applications, each one a completely self-contained unit that can be required into your app.js file and combined however you want.
